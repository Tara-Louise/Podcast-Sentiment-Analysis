After making the streamlit app, the next step was to automate it.

This is where Audience Says – Automated Sentiment Analysis Pipeline was developed 

Overview

Audience Says is an automated sentiment analysis pipeline designed to ingest unstructured audience feedback (e.g. podcast comments, reviews, social content), clean and standardise the data, enrich it with AI-driven sentiment and emotion analysis, and surface insights through a lightweight analytics application.

The project focuses on end-to-end automation, data pipeline design, and practical analytics engineering, rather than just model output.

This repository represents the automated backend and data engineering layer that powers the application.
